CVE-2020-12829 affects the sm501 video driver, which is only used for powerpc and SuperH emulation
CONFIG_SM501 is selected by CONFIG_SAM460EX and CONFIG_R2D (from ppc-softmmu and sh4 targets respectively)
We only build for the native architecture so we can nopatch this.

This is resolved in qemu >= 5.0
