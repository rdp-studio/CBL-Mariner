# CVE-2007-0086 has been disputed to be an actual vulnerability. Official Red Hat statement from 1st of November 2007:

    "Red Hat does not consider this issue to be a security vulnerability. The pottential attacker has to send acknowledgement
     packets periodically to make server generate traffic. Exactly the same effect could be achieved by simply downloading the file.
     The statement that setting the TCP window size to arbitrarily high value would permit the attacker to disconnect and stop
     sending ACKs is false, because Red Hat Enterprise Linux limits the size of the TCP send buffer to 4MB by default."

In case of CBL-Mariner the default max TCP send buffer size is set to 4 MBs as well.
The configuration is available under '/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem'.
